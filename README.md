# keep-egg
Short script to keep KEF Egg speakers connected by USB from powering down - MacOS

Save this script to your ~/ folder and in OS X Terminal run chmod 755 keepegg.sh

In a separate terminal window, type either ./keepegg.sh or ./keepegg.sh & (to run in background). You can then hide / minimise the terminal window

The script will play the Apple "pop" sound every 300 seconds to keep your speakers from powering down which is a very irritating feature of the KEF Egg speakers when connected by USB

To quit the script, either Ctrl+c to exit the loop or Cmd+w to close the terminal window if running in background
